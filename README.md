# RAG-Powered Document Assistant with Local GUI.
## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive solution for document-based question answering and password reminders. It leverages the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using Google Vertex AI and the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to provide accurate and context-aware responses. The project is developed based on the source repo: [Documentation Retrieval Agent](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/agents/RAG). The system includes additional features for automatic document updates, re-indexing, and a local GUI for user interaction.

## Features
- **Password Reminder and Document Q&A:**
  - Retrieve answers to document-related questions.
  - Provide password reminders securely.
- **RAG Agent Integration:**
  - Uses Google Vertex AI and ADK for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
  - Synthesizes responses with citations from relevant documents.
- **Automatic Updates:**
  - Documents are auto-updated and re-indexed using a task scheduler.
  - Scripts: `schedule_run.vbs` and `check_upload_new_pwd_file.py`.
- **Local GUI:**
  - User-friendly interface implemented in `app.py`. Its replace the default CLI mode from the original repo with some extra features (historical message threads management).

## Installation, Implementation, Deployment and Evaluation 
Follow the instructions on the [RAG-README.md](RAG-README.md).

### IAM Roles
The account to run the setup corpus and upload document needs to have the following IAM Roles:
* Storage Admin
* Vertex AI Administrator

After running the permission setup script `grant_permission.sh`, the service account will be created with the format:
```shell
service-${PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
To verify, that service account will be granted the following roles in IAM:
* Vertex AI Custom Code Service Agent
* RAG Corpus Query Role

## Summary of RAG Agent
The RAG agent is designed to answer document-related questions by leveraging the Vertex AI RAG Engine. It retrieves relevant snippets and synthesizes responses using an LLM. Key features include:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate answers.
- Citation support for transparency.
- Integration with Google Cloud services.

For more details, refer to the [RAG-README.md](RAG-README.md).

## Automatic Document Updates
- **Task Scheduler:** Automates the execution of scripts.
- **Scripts:**
  - `schedule_run.vbs`: Schedules periodic tasks.
  - `check_upload_new_pwd_file.py`: 
    + Checks for new documents edited and updates the corpus (delete old document and upload updated document to the corpus).
    + Log corpus checking & updating history to log file (`schedule/upload_history.log`)


## Local GUI
The local GUI, implemented in `app.py`, provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. It allows users to:

- Submit queries related to uploaded documents.
- Retrieve password reminders securely.
- View responses generated by the RAG agent in real-time.
- Historical thread tracking and managing (view & delete old threads)

The GUI is designed to simplify user interaction, making it accessible even for non-technical users. To run the GUI, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
In Windows, users can create a desktop shortcut linked to the `run_app.bat` file for quick access. Simply right-click the file, select "Create Shortcut," and place the shortcut on your desktop. Double-clicking the shortcut will launch the application effortlessly.
